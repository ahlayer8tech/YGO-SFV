The local gaming stores list above are confirmed to be hosting tournaments regularly by the author through either attending themself or by trusted sources as of 09/10/2024.

Konami's database shows more than the above listed LGSs in the SF Valley, but that information is unreliable because it shows OTSs that no longer host tournaments and old/outdated tournamet dates for current OTSs.
